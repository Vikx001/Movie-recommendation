# Movie Recommendation App

## Overview

The Movie Recommendation App is a fun project developed to help you and your friends settle the age-old debate: "What movie should we watch tonight?" This app allows users to enter a list of movies, either to get a random recommendation or to rank them based on various factors like IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes score, and more. The project was created as a way to make the movie selection process easier and more enjoyable.

## Features

- **Random Movie Recommendation**: Enter up to five movies and get a random suggestion.
- **Rank Movies**: Get a ranked list of your chosen movies based on factors like ratings, popularity, and hype.
- **Interactive and Engaging UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface with dynamic backgrounds and animations.

## Motivation

This project was created for fun when my friends and I were having trouble deciding on a movie to watch. To settle the debate and make the process more enjoyable, I developed this app to quickly and fairly pick or rank movies based on our preferences.
